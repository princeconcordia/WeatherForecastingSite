# WeatherForecastingSite
I chosed a very friendly UI with cute images and fonts so that even a kid can understand it and just by looking at the images, you can already see and know the weather details of every city and for the UX its very user-friendly and relaxing just by looking at it. Lesser texts, relatable images and a very direct to the point details and informations.
